Amps is a research project to develop a language and runtime for self-improving AI agents. Unlike many existing agent architectures, Amps agents operate in a [reflective programming environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_programming) which allows them to systematically understand and modify their own behavior systems at any level of abstraction.

This project is led by [Daniel Sosebee](https://danielsosebee.com) and builds on the concept of human programming as described and developed in [Methodable](https://a.methodable.com). For questions or ideas, please [reach out via email](mailto:daniel@harmonic.so).

### Agenda

1. Initial research - review existing literature on AI agents, planning systems, and human executive functioning.
2. Problem identification - collect problems that will serve as a realistic test of the efficacy of autonomous AI agents.
3. Human trial recording - record a human (mysel) solving the problems identified in step 2 out loud, on video and in screen recording.
4. Pseudocode development - Write pseudocode programs based on human trial data to symbolically describe the human perceptions, thoughts, and actions.
5. Language spec development - Inspired by the human pseudocode, write a simple language spec for the Amps language.
6. Initial Python library development - develop a Python library that implements the Amps language.
7. Iterative system improvement - execute test runs against the problem list and record success metrics. Use the results to iteratively improve the system and reach a v1 language spec.
8. Fine-tuning data collection - collect a dataset of Amps contexts and correct outputs.
9. LLM fine-tuning - fine-tune an open-source language model on the dataset in order to better generate Amps commands.
10. Full implementation and evaluation - implement the full Amps runtime and evaluate it on the problem list.
11. Documentation - write up the results and publish online.
