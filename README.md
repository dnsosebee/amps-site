# Agent Meta-Programming System Runtime

Amps is a research project to develop a language and runtime for meta-self-improving AI agents. Unlike many existing agent architectures, Amps agents operate in a reflective programming environment which allows them to systematically understand and modify their own behavior systems at any level of abstraction.

This project is led by [Daniel Sosebee](https://danielsosebee.com) and builds on the concept of human programming as described and developed in [Methodable](https://a.methodable.com), the human-programming tool. For questions or ideas, please [reach out via email](mailto:daniel@harmonic.so).
